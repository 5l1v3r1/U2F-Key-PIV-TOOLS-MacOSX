#YubiKey PIV Manager :
Use the YubiKey PIV Manager to pair your YubiKey with macOS Sierra logins.

You can also use the YubiKey PIV Manager for Windows authentication (requires a domain login) to establish an active connection to the Windows Certification Authority, set and change PINs and Personal Unlocking Keys (PUKs), request certificates from a Certification Authority, manage certificates, and reset the PIV applet.

Use the Yubico PIV Tool, with the command line interface, to administer a PIV-enabled YubiKey. This tool is intended for system administrators or more advanced users.
